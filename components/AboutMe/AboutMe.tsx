            <p>GM anon! I&apos;m 0xreeko, a 23 year old Fullstack Web3 Developer and I enjoy solving problems and materialising visions into tangible products. Born in Madrid, and have been living in London for the past 12 years.</p>
            <p>I started my journey off as a freelance Digital Developer back in 2014, covering: Djing, GFX/UI/UX design, Video Editing, Web development and much more. I wrote my first line of code in 2016 and niched down to web development in 2018, to use the experience I built over the years for my web projects.</p>
            <p>After graduating from UoN in 2020, I spent some months learning about the dev side of Web3, leading to transferring my skills to Web3 in Jan 2021. Since then, I&apos;ve helped many devs make the transition from Web2 to Web3. Currently, I&apos;m building RuskelUI, a component library for rapid Web3 development using React, TailwindCSS and Storybook.</p>
